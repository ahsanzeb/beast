    abstract = { Complex transition metal oxides have played a central role in the study of magnetic materials, serving as model systems for explorations of fundamental exchange interactions and the relationships between structural, electronic, and magnetic responses. Enabled by advances in epitaxial synthesis techniques, abrupt heterointerfaces and superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for engineering novel magnetic behavior in oxides. Following a brief introduction to the dominant exchange mechanisms in metal oxides, we review the general means by which interfacial magnetism can be tailored in ABO3 perovskites, including interfacial charge transfer, epitaxial strain and structural coupling, orbital polarizations and reconstructions, and tailoring exchange interactions via cation ordering. Recent examples are provided to illustrate how these strategies have been employed at isolated interfaces and in short-period superlattices. We conclude by briefly discussing underexplored and emerging research directions in the field. }

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Complex oxides exhibit many intriguing phenomena, including metal-insulator transition, ferroelectricity/multiferroicity, colossal magnetoresistance and high transition temperature superconductivity. Advances in epitaxial thin film growth techniques enable us to combine different complex oxides with atomic precision and form an oxide heterostructure. Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that charge transfer across oxide interfaces generally occurs and leads to a great diversity of emergent interfacial properties which are not exhibited by bulk constituents. In this report, we review mechanisms and physical consequence of charge transfer across interfaces in oxide heterostructures. Both theoretical proposals and experimental measurements of various oxide heterostructures are discussed and compared. We also review the theoretical methods that are used to calculate charge transfer across oxide interfaces and discuss the success and challenges in theory. Finally, we present a summary and perspectives for future research.}

Bousquet et al. studied artificial superlattices made from ferroelectric (PbTiO3) and paraelectric (SrTiO3) oxides. They have found a previously unknown type of atom rearrangement at the interfaces between thin films of these materials, leading to an unusual 'improper' ferroelectric effect. The system has a very large dielectric constant that, unlike conventional ferroelectricity, is fairly temperature independent. This is of considerable technological interest as a route to improved materials for high-permittivity dielectric layers in traditional microelectronics as well as for emerging needs in magneto-electric applications.},

Unfortunately, they are rare, and those that do exist have ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties that are typically weak compared with conventional useful ferroelectrics and ferromagnets. A new route to fabricating multiferroics was recently predicted: in theory, magnetically ordered insulators that are neither ferroelectric nor ferromagnetic --- of which there are many --- can be turned into ferroelectric multiferroics by strain from the underlying substrate. June Hyuk Lee et al. now realize this route experimentally for EuTiO3. Their demonstration that a single experimental parameter, strain, can simultaneously control multiple order parameters opens up exciting possibilities for creating useful multiferroic materials.},

volume={572},

pages={624-627},
abstract={The discovery of unconventional superconductivity in (La,Ba)2CuO4 (ref. 1) has motivated the study of compounds with similar crystal and electronic structure, with the aim of finding additional superconductors and understanding the origins of copper oxide superconductivity. Isostructural examples include bulk superconducting Sr2RuO4 (ref. 2) and surface-electron-doped Sr2IrO4, which exhibits spectroscopic signatures consistent with a superconducting gap3,4, although a zero-resistance state has not yet been observed. This approach has also led to the theoretical investigation of nickelates5,6, as well as thin-film heterostructures designed to host superconductivity. One such structure is the LaAlO3/LaNiO3 superlattice7--9, which has been recently proposed for the creation of an artificially layered nickelate heterostructure with a singly occupied {\$}{\$}{\{}d{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}x{\}}^{\{}2{\}}-{\{}y{\}}^{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}band. The absence of superconductivity observed in previous related experiments has been attributed, at least in part, to incomplete polarization of the eg orbitals10. Here we report the observation of superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate that is isostructural to infinite-layer copper oxides11--13. Using soft-chemistry topotactic reduction14--20, NdNiO2 and Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 single-crystal thin films are synthesized by reducing the perovskite precursor phase. Whereas NdNiO2 exhibits a resistive upturn at low temperature, measurements of the resistivity, critical current density and magnetic-field response of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 indicate a superconducting transition temperature of about 9 to 15 kelvin. Because this compound is a member of a series of reduced layered nickelate crystal structures21--23, these results suggest the possibility of a family of nickelate superconductors analogous to copper oxides24 and pnictides25.},

Results for single-layer ferroelectric films of biaxially strained SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and PbTiO3 as well as PbTiO3/SrTiO3 and BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices are described. Theoretical approaches, including first principles, thermodynamic analysis, and phase-field models, are applied to these biaxially strained materials, the assumptions and limitations of each technique are explained, and the predictions are compared. Measurements of the effect of biaxial strain on the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition temperature (TC) are shown, demonstrating the ability of percent-level strains to shift TC by hundreds of degrees in agreement with the predictions that predated such experiments. Along the way, important experimental techniques for characterizing the properties of strained ferroelectric thin films and superlattices, as well as appropriate substrates on which to grow them, are mentioned. }

abstract = {Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3, is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters.}}

abstract = { Complex transition metal oxides span a wide range of crystalline structures and play host to an incredible variety of physical phenomena. High dielectric permittivities, piezo-, pyro-, and ferroelectricity are just a few of the functionalities offered by this class of materials, while the potential for applications of the more exotic properties like high temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance is still waiting to be fully exploited. With recent advances in deposition techniques, the structural quality of oxide heterostructures now rivals that of the best conventional semiconductors, taking oxide electronics to a new level. Such heterostructures have enabled the fabrication of artificial multifunctional materials. At the same time they have exposed a wealth of phenomena at the boundaries where compounds with different structural instabilities and electronic properties meet, giving unprecedented access to new physics emerging at oxide interfaces. Here we highlight some of these exciting new interface phenomena. }

abstract = {A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions?spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital?are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.}}

abstract={This tutorial review discusses the structural and electronic consequences of the Jahn--Teller effect in transition metal complexes, focussing on copper(ii) compounds which tend to be the most studied. The nature of a Jahn--Teller distortion in molecular complexes and extended lattices can be manipulated by application of pressure or temperature, by doping a molecule into a host lattice, or simply by molecular design. Many of these results have been achieved using compounds with a trans-[CuX4Y2] coordination sphere, which seems to afford copper centres that are particularly sensitive to their environment. Jahn--Teller distortions lead to some unusual phenomena in molecular magnetism, and are important to the functionality of important classes of conducting and superconducting ceramics.},

While exchange and correlation are responsible to the stability of magnetic moment, magnetic ordering is controlled by orbital hybridization, which depends on the atomic arrangement and the mode of orbital occupation. Transition-metal oxides serve as an important playground where unique properties and phenomena can be observed as results of close correlation among magnetism, orbital ordering and lattice distortion. Fundamental aspects of their close correlation are discussed by taking some typical examples: LaMnO3, Ca2âˆ’xSrxRuO4 and Sr2FeMO6 (M=Mo, W and Re).}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Ruddlesdenâ€“Popper halide perovskites are highly versatile quasi-two-dimensional energy materials with a wide range of tunable optoelectronic properties. Here we use the all-inorganic CsPb n X Ruddlesdenâ€“Popper perovskites with X = I, Br, and Cl to systematically model the effect of octahedral tilting distortions on the energy landscape, band gaps, macroscopic polarization, and the emergence of Rashba-/Dresselhaus splitting in these materials. We construct all unique nâ€‰=â€‰1 and nâ€‰=â€‰2 structures following from octahedral tilts and use first-principles density functional theory to calculate total energies, polarizations and band structures, backed up by band gap calculations using the GW approach. Our results provide design rules for tailoring structural distortions and band-structure properties in all-inorganic Ruddlesdenâ€“Popper perovskites through the interplay of the amplitude, direction, and chemical character of the antiferrodistortive distortion modes contributing to each octahedral tilt pattern. Our work emphasizes that, in contrast to three-dimensional perovskites, polar structures may arise from a combination of octahedral tilts, and Rashba-/Dresselhaus splitting in this class of materials is determined by the direction and Pb-I orbital contribution of the polar distortion mode.}

The 2×2 matrix Hamiltonian which is derived is shown to reduce to two one?dimensional Hamiltonians provided a certain minimum amount of symmetry is present. Some general selection rules governing electronic transitions to these states from the ground state are obtained, showing that the spectral distribution in hot bands may differ considerably from that in normal bands when vibronic coupling occurs. A special model which considers the coupling to arise from a single mode of vibration is presented. Two limiting cases which can be treated approximately by perturbation theory are considered in detail. These are shown to give rise to a ``pseudo Jahn?Teller effect'' and to vibrational borrowing in the two different limits.}",

abstract = {It is shown that in perovskite-type crystals the presence of two closely situated zones of opposite parity one of which is not filled, makes possible a lattice instability as regards the odd nuclear displacement taking the inversion center off, which leads to the spontaneous crystal polarisation. A qualitative explanation of the origin of all observed phases and some other features of the ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 is given.}

    abstract = { In the following we investigate the conditions under which a polyatomic molecule can have a stable equilibrium configuration when its electronic state has orbital degeneracy, i. e. degeneracy not arising from the spin. We shall show that stability and degeneracy are not possible simultaneously unless the molecule is a linear one, i. e. unless all the nuclei in the equilibrium configuration lie on a straight line. We shall see also that the instability is only slight if the degeneracy is due solely to electrons having no great influence on the binding of the molecule. We first note that if accidental degeneracy (i. e. degeneracy not caused by symmetry) is disregarded then a degenerate electronic state necessarily entails a symmetrical nuclear configuration. Thus in order to cover all cases we may first consider each possible type of symmetry separately and discuss what nuclear configurations are consistent with each symmetry. A given molecule will possess a continuous set of configurations consistent with one definite type of symmetry, and among these configurations there may be one with a minimum electronic energy. This configuration is then stable with respect to all totally symmetrical nuclear displacements (i. e. displacements which do not disturb the symmetry). We shall have to investigate its stability with respect to all other nuclear displacements. }

abstract = {A new parameterization is defined for the quantitative description of octahedral tilting in orthorhombic and tetragonal perovskites. It contains six parameters, {\it s}${\sb 1}$, {\it s}${\sb 2}$, {\it s}${\sb 3}$, {\it {$\theta$}${\sb x}$}, {\it {$\theta$}${\sb y}$} and {\it {$\theta$}${\sb z}$}. {\it s}${\sb 1}$, {\it s}${\sb 2}$ and {\it s}${\sb 3}$ refer to the lengths of the lines or `stalks' joining pairs of opposite octahedral vertices, and {\it {$\theta$}${\sb x}$}, {\it {$\theta$}${\sb y}$} and {\it {$\theta$}${\sb z}$} to the angles subtended by these stalks with pseudo-cubic axes {\it x}, {\it y} and {\it z}. An equation is derived for the dependence of polyhedral volume ratio, {\it V${\sb a}$} / {\it V${\sb B}$}, on these parameters: {\it V${\sb a}$} / {\it V${\sb B}$} = 6cos${\sp 2}${\it {$\theta$}${\sb m}$} cos {\it {$\theta$}${\sb z}$} {$-$} 1, where {\it {$\theta$}${\sb m}$} = ({\it {$\theta$}${\sb x}$} + {\it {$\theta$}${\sb y}$})/2. To a good approximation, lengths {\it s}${\sb 1}$, {\it s}${\sb 2}$ and {\it s}${\sb 3}$ do not affect {\it V${\sb a}$} / {\it V${\sb B}$}. The validity of this equation is tested by reference to the known crystal structures of 48 ternary oxide and fluoride perovskites, and its versatility demonstrated by application to the structures of some ternary palladium and platinum hydrides. The relationship of the approach to Glazer's system of nomenclature for octahedral tilting in perovskites is considered, in particular concerning the numbers of tilts operative in a given structure. A comparison is also made with the parameterization proposed for octahedral tilting and distortion in rhombohedral perovskites [Thomas & Beitollahi (1994). {\it Acta Cryst.} B{\bf 50}, 549{--}560]. Factors governing the choice of rhombohedrai or orthorhombic symmetry are discussed, with the significance of rhombohedral symmetry in obtaining ferroelectric properties brought out. Through the compilation of a table of {\it A}O${\sb 12}$ and {\it B}O${\sb 6}$ polyhedral volumes, the prospect is identified of predicting both the degree of octahedral tilting and the likelihood of ferroelectric behaviour for novel, hypothetical oxide compositions.},

abstract = {The 23 Glazer tilt systems describing octahedral tilting in perovskites have been investigated. The various tilt systems have been compared in terms of their {\it A}-cation coordination and it is shown that those tilt systems in which all the {\it A}-cation sites remain crystallographically equivalent are strongly favored, when all the {\it A} sites are occupied by the same ion. Calculations based on both ionic and covalent models have been performed to compare the seven equivalent {\it A}-site tilt systems. Both methods predict that when the tilt angles become large, the orthorhombic {\it a}${\sp +}${\it b}${\sp {$-$}}${\it b}${\sp {$-$}}$ tilt system will result in the lowest energy structure. This tilt system gives the lowest energy structure because it maximizes the number of short {\it A}{---}O interactions. The rhombohedral {\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}$ tilt system gives a structure with a slightly lower Madelung energy, but increased ion{--}ion repulsions destabilize this structure as the tilt angles increase. Consequently, it is stabilized by highly charged {\it A} cations and small to moderate tilt angles. The ideal cubic {\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}$ tilt system is only observed when stabilized by oversized {\it A} cations and/or {\it M}{---}O {$\pi$}-bonding. Tilt systems with nonequivalent {\it A}-site environments are observed when at least two {\it A} cations with different sizes and/or bonding preferences are present. In these compounds the ratio of large-to-small cations dictates the most stable tilt system.},

abstract = {In transition metal oxides, preferential occupation of specific {\it d} orbitals on the transition metal ion can lead to the development of a long-range ordered pattern of occupied orbitals. This phenomenon, referred to as orbital ordering, is usually observed indirectly from the cooperative Jahn{--}Teller distortions (CJTDs) that result as a consequence of the orbital ordering. This paper examines the interplay between orbital ordering, octahedral tilting and cation ordering in perovskites. Both ternary {\it AMX}${\sb 3}$ perovskites containing an active Jahn{--}Teller (J{--}T) ion on the octahedral site and quaternary {\it A}${\sb {\it 2}}${\it MM}{$^\prime$}{\it X}${\sb 6}$ perovskites containing a J{--}T ion on one-half of the octahedral sites have been examined. In {\it AMX}${\sb 3}$ perov{\-}skites, the tendency is for the occupied 3{\it d}${\sb 3{\it x}${\sp 2}$}$${\sb {$-$}{\it r}${\sp 2}$}$ and 3{\it d}${\sb 3{\it z}${\sp 2}$}$${\sb {$-$}{\it r}${\sp 2}$}$ orbitals to order in the {\it ac} plane, as exemplified by the crystal structures of LaMnO${\sb 3}$ and KCuF${\sb 3}$. This arrangement maintains a favorable coordination environment for the anion sites. In {\it AMX}${\sb 3}$ perovskites, octahedral tilting tends to enhance the magnitude of the J{--}T distortions. In {\it A}${\sb 2}${\it MM}{$^\prime$}{\it X}${\sb 6}$ perovskites, the tendency is for the occupied 3{\it d}${\sb 3{\it z}${\sp 2}$}$${\sb {$-$}{\it r}${\sp 2}$}$ orbitals to align parallel to the {\it c} axis. This pattern maintains a favorable coordination environment about the symmetric {\it M}{$^\prime$}-cation site. The orbital ordering found in rock-salt ordered {\it A}${\sb 2}${\it MM}{$^\prime$}{\it X}${\sb 6}$ perovskites is compatible with octahedral rotations about the {\it c} axis (Glazer tilt system {\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}${\it c}${\sp {$-$}}$) but appears to be incompatible with GdFeO${\sb 3}$-type octahedral tilting (tilt system {\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it b}${\sp +}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}$).},

Two common Jahn{--}Teller ordering schemes are associated with the irreducible representations {M}_2^+ and {R}_3^ + of the space group Pm\overline 3m. A third, less-common ordering scheme is associated with \Gamma _3^ +. These combine with tilting instabilities associated with {M}_3^ + and {R}_4^ + to generate a predicted suite of Jahn{--}Teller structure types that includes many of the known structures of manganites, vanadates, Cu and Cr halides. Order-parameter coupling and possible phase transitions are described using Landau free-energy expansions, and general expressions for the relationships between symmetry-adapted spontaneous strains and particular order-parameter components are presented. These provide a general formal framework for determining structural evolution across multi-component order-parameter space and for characterizing the influence of tilting instabilities on Jahn{--}Teller instabilities or of Jahn{--}Teller ordering on octahedral tilting.},
